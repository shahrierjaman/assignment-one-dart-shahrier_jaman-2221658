## üìù Assignment Questions

### Question 1: Basic Data Types & Functions (Difficulty: 1/5) ‚≠ê

Create a Dart program that demonstrates basic data types and function usage.

**Requirements:**
1. Create variables of different data types: `String`, `int`, `double`, `bool`
2. Write a function called `calculateBMI` that takes weight (double) and height (double) as parameters and returns the BMI as a double
3. Write a function called `getGrade` that takes a score (int) and returns a grade (String) based on:
   - 90-100: A
   - 80-89: B
   - 70-79: C
   - 60-69: D
   - Below 60: F
4. Use string interpolation to display the results

**Expected Output:**
```
Name: John Doe, Age: 25, Height: 5.9, Is Student: true
BMI: 22.5
Grade: B
```

### Question 2: Collections & Control Flow (Difficulty: 2/5) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

Build a student management system using Lists and Maps.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a `List<String>` of student names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"]
2. Create a `Map<String, int>` to store student scores
3. Use a for loop to assign random scores (60-100) to each student
4. Find and display:
   - The student with the highest score
   - The student with the lowest score
   - The average score of all students
5. Use a switch statement to categorize students:
   - 90-100: "Excellent"
   - 80-89: "Good"
   - 70-79: "Average"
   - Below 70: "Needs Improvement"

**Hint:** Use `import 'dart:math';` for random number generation.

### Question 3: Classes & Objects (Difficulty: 3/5) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Create a `BankAccount` class with the following specifications:

**Class Requirements:**
1. **Properties:**
   - `String accountNumber`
   - `String accountHolder`
   - `double balance`
   - `String accountType` (Savings/Checking)

2. **Constructor:**
   - Initialize all properties
   - Set initial balance to 0.0

3. **Methods:**
   - `deposit(double amount)`: Add money to account
   - `withdraw(double amount)`: Remove money from account (check for sufficient funds)
   - `getBalance()`: Return current balance
   - `displayAccountInfo()`: Show account details

4. **Create 3 bank accounts** and demonstrate:
   - Depositing money
   - Withdrawing money
   - Displaying account information
   - Handling insufficient funds scenario

**Expected Output:**
```
Account: 12345, Holder: Alice, Type: Savings, Balance: 1500.0
Account: 67890, Holder: Bob, Type: Checking, Balance: 800.0
Insufficient funds for withdrawal of 1000.0 from account 67890
```

### Question 4: Inheritance & Polymorphism (Difficulty: 4/5) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Create a vehicle management system using inheritance and polymorphism.

**Requirements:**
1. **Abstract Class `Vehicle`:**
   - Properties: `String brand`, `String model`, `int year`
   - Abstract method: `void start()`
   - Abstract method: `void stop()`
   - Concrete method: `void displayInfo()`

2. **Concrete Classes:**
   - `Car` extends `Vehicle`
     - Additional property: `int numberOfDoors`
     - Override `start()` and `stop()` methods
   - `Motorcycle` extends `Vehicle`
     - Additional property: `bool hasWindshield`
     - Override `start()` and `stop()` methods

3. **Create a list of vehicles** and demonstrate polymorphism by calling `start()`, `stop()`, and `displayInfo()` on each vehicle

4. **Add a method** to calculate vehicle age (current year - vehicle year)

**Expected Output:**
```
Vehicle Info: 2020 Toyota Camry (4 doors)
Starting the car engine...
Stopping the car engine...

Vehicle Info: 2021 Honda CBR (Has windshield: true)
Starting the motorcycle engine...
Stopping the motorcycle engine...

Car age: 4 years
Motorcycle age: 3 years
```

### Question 5: Advanced Features & Mixins (Difficulty: 5/5) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Create a comprehensive employee management system using advanced Dart features.

**Requirements:**
1. **Mixin `Payable`:**
   - Method: `double calculateSalary(double baseSalary, double bonus)`
   - Method: `void processPayment(double amount)`

2. **Mixin `Reportable`:**
   - Method: `String generateReport(String employeeName, String department)`

3. **Abstract Class `Employee`:**
   - Properties: `String name`, `String id`, `String department`
   - Abstract method: `String getJobTitle()`
   - Abstract method: `double getBaseSalary()`

4. **Concrete Classes:**
   - `Manager` extends `Employee` with `Payable` and `Reportable`
     - Additional property: `int teamSize`
     - Override required methods
   - `Developer` extends `Employee` with `Payable`
     - Additional property: `String programmingLanguage`
     - Override required methods

5. **Create employees** and demonstrate:
   - Salary calculation with bonus
   - Payment processing
   - Report generation (for managers)
   - Display all employee information

**Expected Output:**
```
Manager: John Smith (ID: M001, Department: IT, Team Size: 5)
Job Title: Manager
Base Salary: 8000.0
Calculated Salary: 9000.0
Payment processed: 9000.0
Report: Monthly report for John Smith in IT department

Developer: Alice Johnson (ID: D001, Department: IT, Language: Dart)
Job Title: Senior Developer
Base Salary: 6000.0
Calculated Salary: 6500.0
Payment processed: 6500.0
```
