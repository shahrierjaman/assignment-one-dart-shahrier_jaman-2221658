## üöÄ Getting Started - Step by Step Instructions

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
   - This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/assignment-one-dart.git
   cd assignment-one-dart
   ```

### Step 2: Create Your Own Repository

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub.com and click the "+" icon
   - Select "New repository"
   - **Repository name:** `assignment-one-dart-YOUR_NAME-YOUR_IUB_ID` (replace YOUR_NAME with your actual name and YOUR_IUB_ID with your IUB ID)
   - Make it **Public**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect Your Local Repository to Your New GitHub Repository:**
   ```bash
   # Remove the original remote
   git remote remove origin
  
   # Add your new repository as origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/assignment-one-dart-YOUR_NAME.git
  
   # Push your code to your new repository
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Dart SDK:**
   - Visit [dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
   - Download and install Dart SDK for your operating system
   - Verify installation: `dart --version`

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

### Step 4: Complete the Assignment

Work through each question in the `question1.dart` through `question5.dart` files. Each file contains detailed TODO comments to guide you.

### Step 5: Test Your Solutions

1. **Run All Tests:**
   ```bash
   dart test
   ```

2. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   All tests should pass! ‚úÖ
   ```

3. **Take a Screenshot:**
   - Run `dart test` in your terminal
   - Take a screenshot showing all tests passing
   - Save it as `test-results.png` in your repository

### Step 6: Submit Your Work

1. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   ```bash
   # Add all your changes
   git add .
   
   # Commit with a descriptive message
   git commit -m "Complete Dart assignment - all questions implemented"
   
   # Push to your repository
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Submit Your Repository:**
   - Share the link to your GitHub repository
   - Include the screenshot of passing tests
   - Make sure your repository is public so we can access it

## üìù Assignment Questions

### Question 1: Basic Data Types & Functions

Create a Dart program that demonstrates basic data types and function usage.

**Requirements:**
1. Create variables of different data types: `String`, `int`, `double`, `bool`
2. Write a function called `calculateBMI` that takes weight (double) and height (double) as parameters and returns the BMI as a double
3. Write a function called `getGrade` that takes a score (int) and returns a grade (String) based on:
   - 90-100: A
   - 80-89: B
   - 70-79: C
   - 60-69: D
   - Below 60: F
4. Use string interpolation to display the results

**Expected Output:**
```
Name: John Doe, Age: 25, Height: 5.9, Is Student: true
BMI: 22.5
Grade: B
```

### Question 2: Collections & Control Flow

Build a student management system using Lists and Maps.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a `List<String>` of student names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"]
2. Create a `Map<String, int>` to store student scores
3. Use a for loop to assign random scores (60-100) to each student
4. Find and display:
   - The student with the highest score
   - The student with the lowest score
   - The average score of all students
5. Use a switch statement to categorize students:
   - 90-100: "Excellent"
   - 80-89: "Good"
   - 70-79: "Average"
   - Below 70: "Needs Improvement"

**Hint:** Use `import 'dart:math';` for random number generation.

### Question 3: Classes & Objects

Create a `BankAccount` class with the following specifications:

**Class Requirements:**
1. **Properties:**
   - `String accountNumber`
   - `String accountHolder`
   - `double balance`
   - `String accountType` (Savings/Checking)

2. **Constructor:**
   - Initialize all properties
   - Set initial balance to 0.0

3. **Methods:**
   - `deposit(double amount)`: Add money to account
   - `withdraw(double amount)`: Remove money from account (check for sufficient funds)
   - `getBalance()`: Return current balance
   - `displayAccountInfo()`: Show account details

4. **Create 3 bank accounts** and demonstrate:
   - Depositing money
   - Withdrawing money
   - Displaying account information
   - Handling insufficient funds scenario

**Expected Output:**
```
Account: 12345, Holder: Alice, Type: Savings, Balance: 1500.0
Account: 67890, Holder: Bob, Type: Checking, Balance: 800.0
Insufficient funds for withdrawal of 1000.0 from account 67890
```

### Question 4: Inheritance & Polymorphism

Create a vehicle management system using inheritance and polymorphism.

**Requirements:**
1. **Abstract Class `Vehicle`:**
   - Properties: `String brand`, `String model`, `int year`
   - Abstract method: `void start()`
   - Abstract method: `void stop()`
   - Concrete method: `void displayInfo()`

2. **Concrete Classes:**
   - `Car` extends `Vehicle`
     - Additional property: `int numberOfDoors`
     - Override `start()` and `stop()` methods
   - `Motorcycle` extends `Vehicle`
     - Additional property: `bool hasWindshield`
     - Override `start()` and `stop()` methods

3. **Create a list of vehicles** and demonstrate polymorphism by calling `start()`, `stop()`, and `displayInfo()` on each vehicle

4. **Add a method** to calculate vehicle age (current year - vehicle year)

**Expected Output:**
```
Vehicle Info: 2020 Toyota Camry (4 doors)
Starting the car engine...
Stopping the car engine...

Vehicle Info: 2021 Honda CBR (Has windshield: true)
Starting the motorcycle engine...
Stopping the motorcycle engine...

Car age: 4 years
Motorcycle age: 3 years
```
